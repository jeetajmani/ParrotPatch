# Parrot Patch
A Max Patch that records audio into a buffer and plays back two repeated pitch-shifted variants of the recorded audio.
The first audio playback is ramped from -400 cents to 0 cents of pitch shifting over the duration of the clip, and the second is ramped from 0 cents to 400 cents of pitch shifting.
